# Arbitrary Precision Calculator (APC)

This project implements a command-line arbitrary precision calculator in C that can perform arithmetic operations on extremely large or small numbers. Standard `int` or `float` data types are not used; instead, numbers are stored and processed as linked lists to achieve high precision.

Developed as part of the Data Structures module during embedded systems training at Emertxe.

## Features

- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Handles numbers far beyond standard C data type limits
- Accepts input in string format and processes it digit by digit
- Uses doubly linked lists for number representation
- CLI-based interface for user interaction

## Technologies Used

- C Programming
- Doubly Linked Lists
- String Manipulation and Parsing
- GCC Compiler


## Learning Outcomes

- Learned how to build arithmetic logic without relying on built-in data types
- Gained hands-on experience with linked list manipulation and algorithm design
- Applied core data structures for solving real-world computing problems
